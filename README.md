- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @manuelsmueller
	I research the situational risks of autonomous systems in dynamic, diverse environments to enhance their safety. I focus on AI systems that excel in broad contexts but may fail in specific situations. Additionally, I explore methods for identifying and addressing limitations in Digital Twin models, employing reinforcement learning and statistical analytics.
